# ✍️ Full-Stack Role-Based Blog Application (MERN)



A modern, responsive, and secure blogging platform built with the **MERN Stack**. Designed with an enterprise-grade **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** architecture to deliver distinct experiences for Readers, Creators, and Administrators.

## 🌟 1. Project Vision & Core Features

This platform is engineered to handle complex data relationships, multi-tenant roles, and industry-standard security practices.

### 🔐 Security & Persistence
- **Stateless Authentication:** Implements JWT-based auth where tokens are stored in `HTTP-Only` cookies, mitigating XSS and session hijacking.
- **Data Integrity:** Strict Mongoose schemas with pre-save hooks for password hashing (`bcryptjs`).
- **Media Hosting:** Integrated Cloudinary pipeline for dynamic user profile image management.

### 📝 Content & Engagement
- **Soft Deletion Architecture:** Articles are never hard-deleted; instead, they are deactivated (`isArticleActive: false`) for auditing and recovery.
- **Interactive Commenting:** Real-time engagement via subdocument-based comments on articles.
- **Categorization:** Smart filtering for Technology, AI, Programming, and Web Development.

## 👥 2. Roles & Permissions (RBAC)

The application features a granular Three-Tier role system that dictates the UI layout and API access.

| Role | Permissions & Capability Scope |
| :--- | :--- |
| **USER (Reader)** | Can register, login, browse all active articles, manage their own profile, and post comments on articles. |
| **AUTHOR (Creator)** | Inherits USER capabilities + access to a Private Dashboard. Can write, edit, and toggle the status of their own articles. |
| **ADMIN (Manager)** | Full system oversight. Can manage all users (Block/Unblock), moderate any article on the platform, and view system-wide stats. |
